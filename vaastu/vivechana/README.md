# Vivechana (Critical Examination)

This directory holds the **Nidaan** (निदान) documents, which are the Root Cause Analyses (RCAs) for incidents and outages within Project Brahmanda.

**Vivechana** is the process of "critical examination" or "detailed inquiry." After an incident occurs, this is where the `Nidaan` (diagnosis) is documented. Each report serves as a blameless post-mortem, dissecting the event to understand the fundamental cause, the impact, the actions taken to resolve it, and the lessons learned to prevent a recurrence.

These documents are critical for the project's resilience and adherence to the "Asanga Shastra," as they help turn failures into opportunities for strengthening the system.
