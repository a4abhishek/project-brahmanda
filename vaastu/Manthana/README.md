# **Manthana (The Churning)**

This directory contains the detailed rationale, discussions, and debates behind the architectural decisions made in Project Brahmanda (RFCs). The word "Manthana" in Sanskrit means "to churn," and this directory is where we churn ideas to arrive at a consensus.

Each Request For Comments (RFC) in this directory corresponds to an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) in the `Vidhana` directory. The ADRs in `Vidhana` are concise summaries of the decisions, while the documents in this directory provide the full context and reasoning.
