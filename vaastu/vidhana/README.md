# **Vidhana (The Rules)**

This directory contains the **Vidhana** of Project Brahmanda, which are the formal Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

The word **Vidhana** can be translated as "rules," "constitution," or "ordinance." Each ADR in this directory is a constitutional-level document that records a significant architectural decision.

These ADRs are intentionally concise, summarizing the context, decision, and consequences. For the detailed debate, rationale, and alternative considerations behind each decision, please refer to the corresponding document in the [**Manthana**](../Manthana) directory.
