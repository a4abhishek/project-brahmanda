# Vidhana (The Rules)

**Vidhana** represents the rules that govern the Brahmanda.

This directory contains the **vidhana** of Project Brahmanda, which are the formal Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). An ADR is the **single source of truth** for a significant architectural decision.

- **Purpose:** To record a final, binding architectural decision in a comprehensive and self-contained manner.
- **Content:** Each ADR provides the context for the decision, the decision itself, and **the complete, canonical implementation details**, including any necessary commands or code snippets. A developer should be able to implement the decision using only the ADR as a reference.
- **Relationship to RFCs:** While an ADR links to the corresponding RFC in the [**manthana**](../manthana) directory for the full history of the debate, it is not merely a summary. It is the final technical specification.
