# Manthana (The Churning)

This directory contains the detailed rationale, discussions, and debates behind the architectural decisions made in Project Brahmanda (RFCs). The word "manthana" in Sanskrit means "to churn," and this directory is where we churn ideas to arrive at a consensus.

- **Purpose:** An RFC (Request For Comments) is a proposal document. It is created to explore a problem, evaluate alternatives, and propose a solution.
- **Content:** It should contain the full context of the problem and a detailed proposal, which may include high-level implementation ideas for the sake of debate.
- **Relationship to ADRs:** Once an RFC is debated and a decision is reached, the final, binding specification is recorded in an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) in the [`vidhana`](../vidhana) directory. The ADR is the single source of truth for the implementation; the RFC serves as the historical record of the debate.

- **RFCs (The Churning):** Discussing ideas.
- **ADRs (The Law):** Finalized idea with implementation details.
- **Sarga/Visarga (The Manuals):** The user-facing manuals contain the final, step-by-step *how-to* instructions to completely "manifest" the "Brahmanda".
